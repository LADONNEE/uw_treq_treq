<p>
    Frequently supplemental files are needed to process requests in TREQ. For example: 
</p>

<ul class="bullet">
    <li>Receipts scanned as PDF files</li>
    <li>Signed food approval documents</li>
    <li>Conference agendas</li>
    <li>Invoice to be paid</li>
</ul>

<p>
    To make managing files easier for you and the fiscal team, we are storing files related 
    to TREQ in a OneDrive file share. This gives you drag-and-drop file management, 
    ability to preview files online and to share files with your team. 
</p>

<p>
    The fiscal office has designated a specific OneDrive folder you should use for your 
    TREQ requests. Use the link on this page to access your folder where you will create a unique sub-folder for each specific Project.
</p>

<p>
    Create one folder per TREQ Project using the Project Number as the folder name, e.g. TREQ001234. 
    If you don't have a TREQ OneDrive folder yet, contact your financial manager to get set up.
</p>

<h3 class="mt-4">Project Folder Name</h3>

<p>
    Your budget manager will give you instructions for how to organize your TREQ
    attachments in OneDrive. Generally they want you to create a folder per TREQ
    project, using the Project Number as the folder name. TREQ Project Numbers
    look like "TREQ001234".
</p>

<p>
    These folder names are just suggestions. It is up to you to create the folder in
    OneDrive. If your project has its own organization, understood by your fiscal budget
    manager, you should continue to use that.
